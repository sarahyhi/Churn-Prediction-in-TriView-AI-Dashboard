## Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive analytics dashboard for customer churn using machine learning techniques integrated with Tableau through TabPy. The aim is to provide real-time insights into customer behavior and predict potential churn to facilitate proactive business decisions.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, for churn prediction.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards built with Tableau that provide real-time predictions, insights into key drivers, and actionable metrics.
- **Integration with TabPy**: Seamlessly integrates Python-based predictive analytics into Tableau for dynamic and real-time reporting.
- **Generative AI for Reporting**: Automatically generates insightful reports to summarize trends and predictions, streamlining communication with stakeholders.

### Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**
 - Data Cleaning and Analysis: Performed preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing features using Python libraries (*pandas, numpy*).
 - Exploratory Analysis: Identified key attributes influencing churn through visualization (*matplotlib, seaborn*) and feature engineering.
2. **Machine Learning**
 - Trained multiple models on structured data to evaluate predictive accuracy.
 - Selected the most suitable model based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
3. **TabPy Setup**
 - Installed and configured TabPy for real-time model integration into Tableau.
 - Exported preprocessed datasets and model outputs for compatibility with Tableauâ€™s requirements.
4. **Prediction and Visualization**
 - Deployed machine learning predictions in Tableau using TabPy.
 - Designed an interactive dashboard to display real-time predictions and visualize feature importance.
5. **Generative AI Extension**
 - Integrated a text-generation module to automate reporting, providing actionable insights based on prediction outcomes.
