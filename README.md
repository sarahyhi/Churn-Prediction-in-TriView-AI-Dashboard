## Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive analytics dashboard for customer churn using machine learning techniques integrated with Tableau through TabPy. The aim is to provide real-time insights into customer behavior and predict potential churn to facilitate proactive business decisions.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, for churn prediction.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards created with Tableau that display key metrics and insights derived from the model predictions.
- **Integration with TabPy**: Seamlessly integrates Python-based predictive analytics into Tableau for dynamic and real-time reporting.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tableau (with TabPy installed)
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
   
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up TabPy server:
   ```bash
   tabpy
   
4. Open Tableau and connect to your TabPy server.

### Usage
1. Load your data into the dashboard.
2. Use the integrated machine learning models to make predictions.
3. Visualize the results in real-time through the Tableau dashboard.
